## Instructions

You have an implementation of `FizzBuzz`, with a `Game` class that has a `main` method to let you run it.
Unfortunately the author of the code has made more than a few mistakes, it's your job to identify and fix them, as per the below:

* **Don't use an IDE** use a plain text editor such as Atom https://atom.io/
* List all the errors you can see in the file - there are logical ans stylistic errors, as well as syntactic ones...
* Once you have a list of all the errors try to correct them - still without using your IDE, or a compiler!
* When you think you have a correct submission - you can test it yourself - be strict with yourself, count how many submissions you make:

From the root of your project issue the following command in the terminal:
```
./gradlew run
```
The output from trying to compile and run your code should appear in the console.

This exercise is intended to cover some of the following objectives from the OCA book:

### Chapter 3

#### Core Java APIs

* OCA exam objectives covered in this chapter:
* correct Using Operators and Decision Constructs
* Test equality between Strings and other objects using == and equals()
* correct Creating and Using Arrays
* Declare, instantiate, initialize and use a one-dimensional array
* Declare, instantiate, initialize and use a multi-dimensional array
* correct Working with Selected classes from the Java API
* Creating and manipulating Strings
* Manipulate data using the StringBuilder class and its methods
* Declare and use an ArrayList of a given type
* Create and manipulate calendar data using classes from java.time.LocalDateTime, java.time.LocalDate, java.time.LocalTime, java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter, java.time.Period
* correct Working with Java Data Types
* Develop code that uses wrapper classes such as Boolean, Double, and Integer.

### Chapter 4

#### Methods and Encapsulation

* OCA exam objectives covered in this chapter:
* correct Working with Methods and Encapsulation
* Create methods with arguments and return values; including overloaded methods
* Apply the static keyword to methods and fields
* Create and overload constructors; include impact on default constructors
* Apply access modifiers
* Apply encapsulation principles to a class
* Determine the effect upon object references and primitive values when they are passed into methods that change the values
* correct Working with Selected classes from the Java API
* Write a simple Lambda expression that consumes a Lambda Predicate expression
